# Git for developers

This is an introduction to Git aimed at developers.

## Dependencies

First, install XeTeX (this will install Beamer, Minted, and a bunch of other
things as dependencies):

```bash
$ aptitude install latexmk texlive-xetex texlive-lang-european

* [League Spartan font](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-spartan)
